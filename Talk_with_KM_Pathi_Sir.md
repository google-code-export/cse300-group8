Summary of the talk we had with Pathi sir. He's a visiting faculty and we wanted to know how the visiting faculty have to apply for leave.

Q1. What is the current procedure of applying for leave for you ?

"I just have to send a mail to Ms Astrid ,providing the no. of days I would not be available for. I can later take the classes missed."

Q2. Are you happy with the current process of applying for leave or does having a separate portal for it , make it better for you ?

"I'm pretty happy with the current system . Since I'm a guest faculty , having a separate portal wouldn't appeal to me a lot "
