In any project it is important that the problem is identified and then the members start working on developing a solution for it. Keeping this in mind our group has tried to answer the 5 W's What, Who, When, Why and Where to understand the problem with the help of Faculty. This is just a brief presentation on that. We would be preparing a proper project proposal as we go on. It mentions clearly the 5W's and also the basic structure of our software and what it aims to do.

Here is the link for downloading the Project Presentation(**PDF Format**).
