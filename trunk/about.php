<div class="head">

At IIIT-Delhi, our principle focus is on Research and Development and true to this philosophy, the faculty is involved in a lot of academic research projects.

So when it was brought to our attention that our faculty has to engage in a lot of paperwork to avail their medical allowance or in order to apply for leave, we thought why not make their lives a little easier through the development of a software that would automate these processes.

<br>As part of this project we have developed a software named LeaveDesk, that would enable the process of applying for leave by the faculty become hassle free. This software would help the faculty bypass the complex structure involving a lot of paperwork. They would be able to apply and view records without the hassle and delay of going through the admin staff - with anytime, anywhere access(provided they have access to the web).

It would also facilitate simple yet efficient management of this information for the Administration and would ensure that leaves are properly accounted for.

We even plan to extend this software to all the administrative procedures that transit through multiple authorities and is not computerized, there by avoiding delays and decreasing the probability of human errors
