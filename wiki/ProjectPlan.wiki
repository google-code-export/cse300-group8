This is the *project plan* for the next two weeks w.e.f. *27th August*. 

When a project is being executed by a large group it is imperative that they prepare a plan of action and assign tasks to different members. The project plan ensures that all the members are able to manage the work allotted to them in a phased manner.  

Attached is the link to the Google spreadsheet prepared by us providing specific details of the project plan.

Changes to this spreadsheet would be made at regular intervals.
