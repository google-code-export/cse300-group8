= Introduction =

In software development, our first priority should be to *identify the stakeholders* i.e. the people who are likely to be affected by the proposed software.

= The Stakeholders =

In the case of our software, the stakeholders or lets say the users are the *faculty* and the different *administration departments* such as Finance and HRSS (at least for the 1st phase; we hope to extend this project for other users too). It is important that we understand the user in order to develop a good design for the software because ultimately they are the ones who would be using it.
