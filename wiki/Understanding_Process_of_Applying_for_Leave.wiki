We met the faculty POC to get a hang of the process that is followed by faculty when they have to apply for leave. The faculty POC is Anoop Sir and he gave us a very detailed explanation of the process which is explained next.

= Applying for Leave =

Before talking about the process its important to know the different kinds of leaves available to faculty.

  * Work leave: Work leave is when a faculty is invited to give a talk or present a paper or any such similar purpose. This leave is decided by Director on a case to case basis. It can be paid or unpaid. For this purpose an Invitation mail or paper acceptance mail needs to be attached. There are no restrictions on the number of days. Depends on approving authority i.e. the Director.

  * Earned leave:  A faculty is entitled 30 days of earned leave in an academic year. They are also provided with an option of CARRYING FORWARD their leave in any are left.

  * Vacation Leave: Vacation leave is a kind of earned leave however there is a slight difference. So if you take say 30 days of vacation leave  then Earned leave would count to only 15. 

  * Unpaid leave: Personal leave. Eg: Exceptional cases such as Dr. Raja Sengupta 

  * Casual Leave: 8 leaves in an academic year.  No Carry forward provision in this case. Medical or emergency leaves come under this. It is unpaid.

  * Sabbatical: Case to case. 

*PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR LEAVE*

Request comes to POC who is the AM(HRSS) Anoop Sir in this case and he forwards the request to Director Sir. The director then decides whether to approve the leave or not and the faculty is then notified. The POC is also notified so that he can update his records. 
All this communication is done on mail. The leave record of each faculty is maintained by Anoop Sir.
